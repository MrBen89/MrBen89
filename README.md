# Hi, I'm Ben 👋

I've loved computers since I was a tiny kid playing with a Gameboy and an Amstrad in the '90s.

My programming journey started with that Amstrad. Like most '80s micros, it came with BASIC, making it super easy for a curious kid to write simple programs.

From there, I started making games on Windows XP using simple GUIs, which introduced me to many coding concepts. Customizing folders with HTML (remember folder backgrounds?) led me to simple websites using Geocities and Dreamweaver. The experience wasn't painful enough to keep me from studying computing in college, where I dabbled with Visual Basic and C++.

Years later, my love for coding returned. I picked up JavaScript and explored modern web development, eventually joining Le Wagon's bootcamp to learn Ruby, Rails, and more.

That's a (very) brief overview of my time with computers. I hope I'll have more to add here in the future!
